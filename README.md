# puissance4

Hi! I am Cécile, web developer in the east of France since 2020.

This game is a school project of my first year at the Web@cadémie by Epitech on the Strasbourg campus (FR). We had to write a 'Puissance 4' as a JQuery plug-in.

I worked alone on this project in begining of 2021 and I'm rather proud of the result.

I absolutely loved working there, so it will continue to evolve over time. For now, you can have a full game with a friend, but in the future I would like to integrate an AI to be able to play solo, and more features.
